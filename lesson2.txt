What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    An empty repository gets created with no commits. Respository has a hidden file .git in it , it helps to use the functions of git and helps to start with our own project.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    
    Staging area is like pre assembly area for final stages of commits.I think it offers us a chance to be sure about makin a commit.
