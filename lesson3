When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    I would want to use a remote resipository when im out somewhere, where i have to do my work on another computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    I find it more convenient, I find the project to be in a more controlled state  if i manually pull changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Branches
    There are used for trying out experimental changes which otherwise could not be directly incooperated on the master branch as the changes are still into development and require some time.

    Forks
    Sometimes when we have to use or work on someone else's work, then we use Fork. It gives the original user the credit he/she deserves and we are able to use it freely.

    Clones
    Clones as the name suggests are direct copy of the original project. There are useful for offline work but if we are working or using someone else's work then its better to Fork that repository.

 
What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    If we have the copy of the last known state of the remote then we can avoid the merge conflicts and save the precious time in solving those conflicts.
