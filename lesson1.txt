How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Hard n tedious

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    very much i guess

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    the manually saving allows to create a logical commit rather than a non useful one, automatically saving terminates the user error of not saving as one can forget

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    gives low load on the vc system and helps to keep a common order between files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log shows the commit history (tip add --stat to the command to show more info like insertions deletions )
    git diff is used to find the difference between the two commits (syntax git diff commit_id_1 commit_id_2)

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    much more confident ,its tedious at first but i trust the instructor as she said in future it'll be helpful and so did Jeffrey Middleton

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    My own projects maybe lol

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    An empty repository gets created with no commits. Respository has a hidden file .git in it , it helps to use the functions of git and helps to start with our own    project.
